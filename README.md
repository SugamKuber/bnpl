## Buy now, pay later dapp
### About me
I am a developer who is diving all in to make the experience of the web3 ecosystem spectacular and as relatable and simple as web2. I understand the value of decentralized finance (DeFi). Building this as a bedrock for the emerging content creation world creates massive opportunities for Creators, artists, athletes, and more. I want to unlock this potential by providing easy accessibility and tools to the creators/ artists and embark millions of web2 users to our web3 platform by making the experience simple, relatable, and rewarding. I also come from humble backgrounds meaning many of us donâ€™t have 0.1ETH to spend on exquisite NFTs like the Apes or Doodles. Millions out there are left at the gates of Web3 marketplaces because of such prices and the lack of simple finance options to buy these adorable collectibles.

### What is Solpay trying to crack?

An easy-to-use and highly rewarding crypto application for the next billion users who are web2 natives. What do they need?
Accessibility: DeFi protocols and applications are complex for non-native users, and the fancy trading & lending terms make it even difficult to relate to the web2 world, which makes them hesitant to dive into the world of web3. Solpay makes it accessible for users having either FIAT or Crypto to use the application with smooth onboarding and verification. It allows users to deposit and withdraw the funds in their preferred FIAT/ Cryptocurrency.
Usability: It is difficult to make millions of people use Web3 apps if there is no single product that offers services that resonate with the existing Web2 apps. This is why Solpay employs BNPL as a tool to simplify digital asset transactions and also provide fixed returns on deposits using DeFi. This covers two of the most valuable services in DeFi

**VISION**: Our vision is to make an economy for the creators and artists in the digital space and decentralize the creator's relationship with their followers/fans/subscribers
We began this journey to make digital assets accessible, affordable, and usable for everyone. Now, we believe it is our calling to create a simple networked ecosystem that will enable finance for both consumers and the creators, thus creating a circle of the creator economy.
Our core products will offer sustainable yield, BNPL for easy checkout of NFTs and later e-commerce products, and a stellar lending option for the creators, which involves BNPL.
## FAQ

#### 1. What is Solpay? 
Solpay is the  Creator economy finance protocol that enables consumers and creators to engage effortlessly. Solpay accomplishes this by making NFTs transactions affordable for crypto native and web2 users using our custom BNPL service and repaying in 3 installments with FIAT, ETH, or Stablecoins.

#### 2. What can users do on Solpay?
Users can deposit their fiat money or crypto to receive a high yield from our vault and meanwhile also apply for BNPL access which allows you to purchase NFTs of your choice and repay over three months. 

#### 3. How does Buy Now Pay Later work?
As simple as it sounds, once a user connects their wallet and has the BNPL account verified, they can choose an NFT they want to purchase from a marketplace and drop the name on the BNPL page. The complete details will be shown along with the additional costs. Once the user confirms the NFT, Solpay will make the bid and store the NFT in the treasury while giving the user complete access.

#### 4. Can I buy any NFT available on Opensea? 
Yes, you can buy any NFT of your choice. However, Solpay has a limit of 100$ for non-collateralized purchases. If you have a deposit in our vaults, then it can be taken as collateral for BNPL, allowing you to utilize the total value of the amount to buy your lovely NFT.
